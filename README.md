# CS5600

This page will describe various computer system projects that I have worked on during my time at Northeastern. All projects are written in C++ and will run on any operating system. These projects are small and are meant to mimic a prototype that could be implemented in a Linux operating system (except CS5600 Final Project).

CS5600 Final Project involves me using Windows Sockets to make a small communication applicaiton. 

MLFQ (Multi Level Feedback Queue) - This is suppose to represent how a Computer system will choose which process to run. 

MultiPageTable - This program is designed to represent how a CPU and a translation lookaside buffer brings in a program from RAM (Random Access Memory)

Swapping - This program is designed to represent how a program is loaded and swapped out of Ram/Disk space.

All programs can be run by clicking the play button or by running the test files.
